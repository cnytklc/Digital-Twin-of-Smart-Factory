The design of the smart factory was implemented and evaluated in the Solidworks program, and its simulation was implemented and evaluated in the CoppeliaSim simulation program.
Simulation results show accurate instant monitoring of the smart factory, reflection of instant data into the simulation environment, and double-sided control.

Using the digital twin method, communication between the PLC used in the smart factory and CoppeliaSim was carried out with the help of Application Programming Interface (API).
